Matteo Subet (aka Zumat)  

PhD student in Experimental Sciences and Technology at Elisava (UVic-UCC), working at SUPSI as Design Researcher.  
My research investigates the role of digital literacy and open process documentation in urban manufacturing through a research-by-design approach.  
I focus on developing adaptable guidelines for makerspaces and urban factories, emphasizing inclusivity, accessibility, and local innovation.  
With a background in interaction design and a passion for open knowledge, I combine hands-on experimentation with research, teaching, and community-driven initiatives.  
My work explores how digital tools and collaborative methodologies can support more resilient and decentralized production ecosystems.
